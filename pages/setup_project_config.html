        <h1>Configuring Your Project</h1>

        <h3>FuncGodot Project Config</h3>
        <p>
            FuncGodot has the option of using a <a href="ref_project_config.html"><b>FuncGodotProjectConfig</b></a> resource to create local project wide 
            settings for your other FuncGodot resources. These settings are applied only to your machine, in order to better facilitate working with a team that 
            may not have the same drive or directory setup or even the same map editor as you yourself use.
        </p>
        <p>
            You won't create the FuncGodotProjectConfig resource for your project, as this resource doesn't actually save anything to itself directly. 
            Instead you will use the pre-made <i>func_godot_projet_config.tres</i> resource found in the <i>addons/func_godot/</i> folder.
        </p>
        <p align="center"><img src="../images/setup_project_config_res_loc.png" alt="Location of func_godot_project_config.tres in the Godot project File System."></p>
        
        <h3>Project Config Properties</h3>

        <p>
            Viewing this resource's properties in the inspector, you'll be greeted with some options. We'll ignore the <i>Export Func Godot Settings</i> property for now.
        </p>
        <p align="center"><img src="../images/ref_project_config.png" alt="FuncGodotProjectConfig resource inspector."></p>
        <p>
            For the <b>Map Editor Game Config Folder</b>, you'll want to locate your map editor's game configuration or installation folder and then create a sub folder for 
            your game's configuration. This might look something like <i>C:/GameDev/TrenchBroom/Games/MyGame/</i> or <i>C:/GameDev/J.A.C.K/MyGame/</i>. 
            This tells FuncGodot where the default location to save generated configuration and FGD files.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <b>Map Editor Game Path</b> refers to what your Map Editor considers the location of your project. This might look something like <i>C:/GameDev/MyGodotProject/</i> 
            or <i>C:/GameDev/MyGodotProject/trenchbroom/</i>. The intended use for this is to streamline certain FGD resource paths, like the 
            <a href="ref_trenchbroom_resources.html#ModelPoint"><b>TrenchBroomFGDModelPointClass</b></a>'s model export location.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <b>Game Path Models Folder</b> is the default folder path relative to your Map Editor Game Path that tells FuncGodot where to save generated model files to. For example, 
            with a Map Editor Game Path value of <i>C:/GameDev/MyGodotProject/trenchbroom/</i> and a Game Path Models Folder value of <i>models</i>, the generated model file will 
            be saved to <i>C:/GameDev/MyGodotProject/trenchbroom/models/</i>. Currently only used by <a href="ref_trenchbroom_resources.html#ModelPoint"><b>TrenchBroomFGDModelPointClass</b></a>.
        </p>

        <h3>Exporting the Project Config</h3>
        <p>
            Remember that <i>Export Func Godot Settings</i> property I told you to ignore earlier? Once you have your settings in place, go ahead and click it. 
            It will automatically generate a <i>MyGameFuncGodotConfig.json</i> file in your 
            <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/io/data_paths.html#accessing-persistent-user-data-user" target="_blank">Godot project's user data folder</a>. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This is how we keep local settings local. Upon opening your project, FuncGodot will automatically update <i>func_godot_project_config.tres</i> to load the data from 
            the generated JSON file found in your user data folder, and setting the resource's <i>Export</i> property to true will overwrite that file with the new settings. 
            These settings are not saved to source control, allowing teams to work together more easily and more flexibly.
